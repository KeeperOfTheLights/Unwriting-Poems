Psst, I see dead people
Mustard on the beat, ho

Ay, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo, any rap nigga, he a free-throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo

What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'

Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that upped the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully the flow on him
